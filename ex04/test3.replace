twinkle, twinkle, big star,
how I wonder what you are!
up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky.

twinkle, twinkle, big star,
how I wonder what you are!

when the blazing sun is gone,
when he nothing shines upon.
then you show your big light,
twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

twinkle, twinkle, big star,
how I wonder what you are!
