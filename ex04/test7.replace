, , little star,
how I wonder what you are!
up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky.

, , little star,
how I wonder what you are!

when the blazing sun is gone,
when he nothing shines upon.
then you show your little light,
, , all the night.

, , little star,
how I wonder what you are!
